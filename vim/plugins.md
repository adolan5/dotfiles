# Vim Plugins

The `plugins` directory contains Git submodule definitions pointing to plugins
that I frequently use.

The easiest way to use these plugins with Vim version >=8 is to to create a
symlink `~/.vim/pack/plugins` that points to the `plugins` directory here, then
use `git submodule update --init` to clone the plugins.
