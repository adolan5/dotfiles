# adolan5's dotfiles
##### A collection of configurations

## Vim
Contains adolan5's vimrc (both Linux and Windows). Has (optional) dependency on
kien's ctrlp fuzzy search.

## Bash
There are a number of Bash/terminal resources available here that I find very
convenient, namely:
* Some of my favorite aliases (bash\_alieases)
* Some resources (bash\_resources):
  * Fixes for the Windows 10 Ubuntu shell, such as an explicit screen directory
    and quality-of-life color changes
  * `hag`, a quick function to grep your history
* `shared.sh`: A script I put together for easily mounting a VirtualBox (and
  guest additions) shared directory. This script should be used on the guest OS.

## Git
My `.gitconfig` is available here as well, for core settings and aliases.
